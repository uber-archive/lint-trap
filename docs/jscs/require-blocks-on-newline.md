    "requireBlocksOnNewline": true

This improves readability in 99% of cases. If your going to use a block then
use a new line. putting a block in a single line encourages terse and
unreadable code.Pretty much the only case in which readability is reduced is
single-line `if` statements, and even then some will argue that `if` statements
with only one line in its block is more readable with newlines.
